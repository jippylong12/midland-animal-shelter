# Active Plan: Commit Current UI Work

## Context
- User requested committing the current workspace changes.

## Constraints
- Do not alter behavior or revert files.
- Commit the existing UI/UX changes and related project memory updates as-is.

## Atomic Steps
1. Review changed files and stage all relevant modifications.
2. Create one commit with a clear message describing the UI refresh and follow-up visual tweaks.
3. Report commit hash and summary back to user.
